# Audio-Sentencer-and-Transcriber
This repository contains a Python script that processes audio files by splitting them into sentences based on pauses and generates transcriptions using the Vosk model. The main functionalities include:

##  Read Me: Audio Sentence Segmentation and Transcription

This Python script automates speech-to-text conversion by segmenting audio files into sentences and utilizing the Vosk model for speech recognition.

### Functionalities

* **Audio Processing:** Reads audio files (likely WAV format) and splits them into segments based on pauses in speech.
* **Sentence Segmentation:** Analyzes silence duration and audio properties to identify sentence boundaries.
* **Vosk Integration:** Integrates the Vosk speech recognition model for transcribing each audio segment.
* **Transcription Generation:** Combines transcribed text from each segment to form the complete audio transcription.
* **Output Management:** Saves generated transcriptions to text files (customizable).

### Dependencies

This script likely relies on the following external libraries:

* **Vosk:** Offline, lightweight speech recognition toolkit ([https://alphacephei.com/vosk/](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/))
* **Additional Libraries (Optional):**
    * `pydub` for audio processing ([https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub))

**Installation:**

```bash
pip install vosk  #  and optionally pydub
```

**Download Vosk Model Files:**

Download the appropriate Vosk model for your desired language from the Vosk website and place it in a known location. You'll need the path to this model file during script execution.

### Usage

1.  **Modify Script:** (Optional)
    * Update the script to specify the path to your downloaded Vosk model file.
    * Adjust output behavior (e.g., filename format) for generated transcription files (if applicable).

2. **Run Script:**
    * Execute the script using Python with the audio file path as an argument:

```bash
python script_name.py path/to/your/audio.wav
```

**Example Output:**

The script will likely generate a text file containing the transcribed text from the audio file, potentially segmented by sentences (depending on implementation).


### Additional Notes

* This is a general overview based on the information provided. The specific functionalities and libraries used might vary depending on the script's implementation.
* Consider including instructions on how to handle errors or exceptions encountered during execution.
